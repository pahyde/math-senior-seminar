1. Introduction

    - 1873, Emile Mathieu published description of 5-transitive group of permutations
      on 24 symbols - simple group w/ 244,823,040 elements (M24, the largest Mathieu group)
    - Shannon's "A Mathematical Theory of Communications"
    - Marcel Golay -> Golay code -> extended Golay code G s.t. Aut(G) =~ M24
    - defn of simple groups, classification of simple groups, the 26 sporadic groups
    - Lemma 1, M24 is the only simple group of order 244,823,040
    - Mathieu's construction using 3 permutations a,b,c

    - searching for constructions is a "cottage industry"
    - overview of paper:
        - coding theory, hamming codes, golay codes
        - 2 simple constructions of extended Golay Code
        - relationship between these constructions -> M24
        - visual description of M24
        - 2 more Mathieu groups as stabilizer subgroups within M24

    - Questions
        - 5 transitive group?
        - how to prove a group is simple?
        - how are finite groups constructed from simple groups?
        - how are most sporadic groups constructed? permutations for Mathieu groups?
        - what is the defining property of M24. How do we know a construction gives M24?
        - how a,b,c permutations were used to generate M24? just composition?


2. Error-Correcting Codes
    - defn of binary code of length n - set of vectors from F^n
    - code is linear w/ dim k if it exhausts a subspace of dim k within F^n
    - Hamming and Golay are linear
    - generator matrix basis not unique, distance, min dist, support, weight
    - for linear codes min dist = min weight. cool. 
    - inner-product orthogonality with dot-product mod 2
    - dual code of C, self-dual codes
    - Lemma 2 - words of a binary self-dual code C are vectors in null and row space of
      any given generator matrix for C
    - reliable correction of floor(d-1 / 2) errors per codeword
    - equivalence of 2 codes - permutation of codeword coordinates
    - automorphism of a code - coord perm that preserves original code

    - Questions:
        - How to find basis for subspace of F^n. how many vectors in subspace of given dim?
        - put differently, what is the cardinality of a k-dim vector subspace of F^n
        - parity check vs generator? Would a self-dual parity check be the generator matrix?
        - what precisely is a vector space homomorphism?
        - are vector space homomorphisms necessarily coordiate perms?
        - what about distance-preserving vector space homomorphisms in particular?
        - how to find all automorphisms?
        - find the number of permutations exhausted by set of generator perms?


The Hamming code and its automorphisms
    - block-substitution model 
    - epsilon perm -> cycles the generator matrix N
    - eta is an automorphism that distorts N
    - lifted normal subgroup (some intuition) can I understand this rigorously?
    - |Aut(H)| = 1344
    - quadratic residues mod 7 -> {1,2,4} -> P generator matrix of code V
    - theta (related to eta) permutation is an automorphism
    - equivalence of the two models
    - eps and eta = omega^-1 * theta * omega
    
    - Questions:
        - Why embedding H "into" V gives an isomorphism. again does dim => cardinality?
        - review block designs


3. The extended Golay Code and M24
    - extended Golay 3-error correcting (24, 12, 8) code
    - used in deep space communications, voyager 
    - Given C is linear binary (24, 12, d) code the following are equivalent:
        1) min weight of C is d = 8
        2) C is equivalent to the Golay code 
    - Theorem 2: The full automorphism group of the extended Golay code is isomorphic to M24

Quadratic Residue model of Golay code
    - {1,2,3,4,6,8,9,12,13,16,18}
    - 12 rows of generator Q produced by permutation sigma = (1, 2, ..., 23)(24)
    - ^ additional repeated application of sigma gives linear combs of Q
    - So sigma is an automorphism of the quad residue model

Block Substitution model of Golay code
    - substitute blocks I, I_hat, J into hamming generator matrix H
    - gives matrix G, a self-orthogonal code B with dim 12 and min dist d = 8.
    - By THM 1, B is a Golay code
    - Lemma 5, rho = (1,2,3)(4,5,6)...(22,23,24) is an automorphism of the block-substitution 
      model of the extended Golay code
    - Finding the equivalence map: combinatorial design
    - Lemma 6, perm chi = (6,20,23,15)(7,12,11,8,22,19)(9,10)(16,24) takes B to R
    - argue either by Lemma 1 and order <rho,tau> or by THM 2 and order <rho,tau>
      that <rho, tau> =~ M24

    - Questions:
        - prove: if a perm maps each basis vector in C to a vec in C. Then its an Automorphism
        - best strategy is to used the homomorphism property (h(ab) = h(a)h(b))


Visualizing M24
    - beaded ring visualization 
    - Questions
        - What is a stabalizer subgroup
