Chronological ordering of events
(The narrative)
How many have taken a course in Modern Algebra?
lte half the class -> brief overview of the axioms 
gt half the class  -> you guys know that a group is this thing.. identity, assoc .. etc
closure property will be important
if you have taken / recall that.. a normal group of a group G is a subgroup that divides the group G into left and right cosets which are equal 
Z, 5Z, Z_5 - example (quick)
We're going to try to understand a finite simple group discovered by _, it's denoted M24
a set of |M24| permutations - subset of S24 and our goal is to find a simple and 'natural' representation 
One way to do this is to find generator permutations. We want a minimal set of permutations which can be arbitrarily combined to generate all of M24
so something like abc, where we evaluate right to left.
To do this we really need the right perspective v

** defnitely **

Z5 is cyclic like a clock -> we could represent this as a pentagon
Even more generally 

**************
Big Question - We know that Aut(G) =~ M24 by a theorem.
